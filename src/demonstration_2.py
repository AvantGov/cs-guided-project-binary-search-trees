"""
You are given a binary tree. You need to write a function that can determin if
it is a valid binary search tree.

The rules for a valid binary search tree are:

- The node's left subtree only contains nodes with values less than the node's
value.
- The node's right subtree only contains nodes with values greater than the
node's value.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be valid binary search trees.

Example 1:
Input:

    5
   / \
  3   7

Output: True

Example 2:
Input:

    10
   / \
  2   8
     / \
    6  12

Output: False
Explanation: The root node's value is 10 but its right child's value is 8.
"""

"""
UNDERSTAND: 


PLAN:
is root.left.value < root.value ?
is root.right.value > root.value ?
is root.left valid ?
is root.right valid ?

need to make sure the child nodes are within the allowed bounds of their position in the tree 
in comparison to the root
